Problems after downloading zip file

Some browsers (especially Microsoft Internet Explorer) try to help you by blocking extracted files from a downloaded zip file from network.
Consequences of this blocking:
*.chm help files will not be displayed fully (in our case they only contain harmless help text)
*.exe program files start with a warning dialog.

If you have downloaded the zip file from http://www.gnmidi.com or http://www.gnmidi.at then you can ignore these warnings.

Using Microsoft Explorer you can unlock the blocking of these files in their properties by pressing the button Unblock in the general tab.
